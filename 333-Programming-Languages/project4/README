Write an example program in each language that demonstrates the rules for identifier naming, variable declarations, and identifier scoping. Focus on any special rules or capabilities of your language. Make a blog post with the code and an explanation how the scoping rules apply to the code.
Write an example program in each language that demonstrates all of the basic built-in types and how to construct aggregate types (e.g., records, classes or structures). The program should demonstrate which of the standard suite of operators (+ - / * %) manipulate which types and what the resulting type of each operation is. Use it to explain the type system in your language.
Write an example program in each language that executes a binary seach on a list or array of numbers. Make it a function/method, if possible. Explain the basic syntax of the language, using the binary search program as an example.
